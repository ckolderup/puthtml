# Put HTML

Upload an HTML file <1mb to an S3 bucket, then serve it.

Make sure that AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_BUCKET_NAME are set in your env. Then go crazy.

Also before you go crazy setup your Twitter app and TWITTER_KEY and TWITTER_SECRET in your env.

ALSO right now you need 10+ htmls in your amazon s3 bucket to start.
